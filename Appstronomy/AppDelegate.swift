   - MEMORY: Initially I viewed memory in the Xcode debug navigator. As i used my app on a real device I noticed that memory was not being de-allocated as i thought it should be. I decided to use the Leaks section in Instruments to check the memory usage of my app and as expected it was detecting leaks. I realised that this high memory from coming from the Rover Postcard section of my app so I ensured that all that there weren't any strong reference cycles by ensuring all view controllers in this process were deallocated appropriately. Once I ruled this out I suspected the large memory usage was coming from the many Mars rover images that were being loaded and I knew that the library I am using 'Kingfisher' caches downloaded images not just on the disk but in memory too. With this in mind I went to the docs of the framework and recognised that images are stored in memory cache for 5 mintues before they are removed from memory cahce. This is evident if you run the app, download mars rover photos and after 5 minutes memory usage will drop when the images are purged from memory cahce behind the scenes.
 
   - ENERGY: I could see that my app was using a high amount of energy but this was to be expected as the application will be downloading many images from the NASA API when the user is in the Mars Rover image picker view.
